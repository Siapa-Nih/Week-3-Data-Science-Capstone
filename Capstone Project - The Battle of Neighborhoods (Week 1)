    "However, when one is new or is visiting a city or a place for the first time, they may experience challenges here and there as the they try to find their way in the streets. For example, one may struggle to find a particular museum or maybe one may get a challenge with getting a nice place to relax, have some meal or even a coffee shop. \n",
